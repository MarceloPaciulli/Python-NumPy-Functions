# Python-NumPy-Functions
Each of the methods of the script, returns the same result, only that they implement different procedures, through different Python data structures and functions of the NumPy library, such as: roll, select, delete, flatten, hstack, vstack, cumsum, tile, insert, eye and a large number of tools that Python offers us to think about procedures differently. This is generally investigated, for example, in the software engineering technique known as "code refactoring."

For this example, each method receives an array of size 10, with random values from 1 to 4, inclusive. What it returns is a binary array that identifies the set of different "classes or categories" to which a data set could belong. This, in the study of neural networks, is called a "binary array of expected values"
